Title:<br>
Emily Brooks Portfolio

Description:<br>
I began coding coursework in April of 2020. I've worked on a lot of projects over the months, both in development and design.
This project is my first personal project. I designed this site using PhotoShop, and built it using HTML and CSS. I recently added a "To Top" scroll button using JavaScript (Yay for JavaScript!).
I am always learning new coding skills, so I will continue adding upgrades and features to my site as my skills evolve.

Goal:<br>
As an aspiring frontend developer and career-changer, it is my goal to become employed in web design and development. This
project will continue to showcase skills I've learned since starting this journey in April 2020. It will also provide a way for potential clients,
employers or other industry professionals to connect with me so we can work, or network, together.

Thank you for visiting!
