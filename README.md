Title:<br>
Emily (Wilson) Brooks Portfolio

Description:<br>
I began coding coursework in April of 2020. I've worked on a lot of projects over the months, both in development and design. 
This project is my first personal project. I designed this site using PhotoShop, and am building it using HTML and CSS (JavaScript to come!)
I am building this as I review the fundamentals and continue to learn new skills, so I am adding small 
pieces at a time. It's exciting to see it come together bit by bit!

Goal:<br>
As an aspiring web developer and career-changer, it is my goal to become employed in web design and development. This 
project will showcase the skills I've learned since April 2020. It will also provide a way for potential clients,
employers or other industry professionals to connect with me so we can work, or network, together. 

Thank you for visiting!
