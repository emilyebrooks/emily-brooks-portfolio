Title:<br>
Emily Brooks Portfolio

Description:<br>
I began coding coursework in April of 2020. I've worked on a lot of projects over the months, both in development and design. This project is my first personal project. I designed the site using PhotoShop, and built it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Goal:<br>
As a career-changer, I am excited for my first role as a Junior Front End Developer. This portfolio will continue to showcase my skills and my coding journey. It will also provide a way for other industry professionals to connect with me so we can work, or network, together.

Thank you for visiting!
